By default, MyBB only displays the usergroup image for the primary usergroup on the user's postbit. This plugin enables MyBB to display all usergroup images on the postbit. This plugin is compatible with and tested on MyBB 1.6 and 1.8. 

You can move the {$post['additional_groups']} variable in your 'postbit' and 'postbit_classic' templates wherever you'd like. This plugin may not be compatible with highly customized themes by default. If the plugin does not work with your theme, you will need to manually add this variable to the postbit and postbit_classic templates. 

Installation: 
1) Upload the contents of the "Upload" folder to your MyBB root folder. 
2) Activate "Multiple Usergroup Images on Postbit" via ACP -> Plugins.
